https://www.FedRAMP.gov/documents/
RA-5 (a) Requirement: an accredited independent assessor scans operating systems/infrastructure, web applications, and databases once annually.
RA-5 (d) Requirement: If a vulnerability is listed among the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) Catalog (https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) the KEV remediation date supersedes the FedRAMP parameter requirement.
RA-5 (e) Requirement: to include all Authorizing Officials; for JAB authorizations to include FedRAMP

RA-5 Guidance: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.
Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation Request Form.
Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.

FedRAMP Guidance: SC-13 Guidance:
This control applies to all use of cryptography. In addition to encryption, this includes functions such as hashing, random number generation, and key generation. Examples include the following:
 - Encryption of data
 - Decryption of data
 - Generation of one time passwords (OTPs) for MFA
 - Protocols such as TLS, SSH, and HTTPS

The requirement for FIPS 140 validation, as well as timelines for acceptance of FIPS 140-2, and 140-3 can be found at the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program 

SC-13 Guidance: For NSA-approved cryptography, the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) oversees a national program to evaluate Commercial IT Products for Use in National Security Systems. The NIAP Product Compliant List can be found at the following location:
https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Product/index.cfm 

SC-13 Guidance: When leveraging encryption from underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some IaaS/PaaS provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be configured, and enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify encryption is properly configured. 

SC-13 Guidance:
Moving to non-FIPS CM or product is acceptable when:
- FIPS validated version has a known vulnerability
- Feature with vulnerability is in use
- Non-FIPS version fixes the vulnerability
- Non-FIPS version is submitted to NIST for FIPS validation
- POA&M is added to track approval, and deployment when ready

SC-13 Guidance: At a minimum, this control applies to cryptography in use for the following controls: AU-9(3), CP-9(8), IA-2(6), IA-5(1), MP-5, SC-8(1), and SC-28(1).

SC-28 Guidance: When leveraging encryption from underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some IaaS/PaaS services provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be configured, and enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify encryption is properly configured.

FedRAMP Parameters: SC-28 (1)-1 [all information system components storing Federal data or system data that must be protected at the High or Moderate impact levels]
FedRAMP Guidance: SC-28 (1) Guidance: 
Organizations should select a mode of protection that is targeted towards the relevant threat scenarios. 
Examples:
A. Organizations may apply full disk encryption (FDE) to a mobile device where the primary threat is loss of the device while storage is locked. 
B. For a database application housing data for a single customer, encryption at the file system level would often provide more protection than FDE against the more likely threat of an intruder on the operating system accessing the storage.
C. For a database application housing data for multiple customers, encryption with unique keys for each customer at the database record level may be more appropriate.

Control ID: SC-8
Name: Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity
Description: Protect the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of transmitted information.
FedRAMP Parameters: SC-8 [confidentiality AND integrity]
FedRAMP Guidance: SC-8 Guidance:
For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8 (1),  physical means as specified in SC-8 (5), or in combination.

For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:
 - Crossing the system boundary
 - Between compute instances - including containers
 - From a compute instance to storage
 - Replication between availability zones
 - Transmission of backups to storage
 - From a load balancer to a compute instance
 - Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.

The following applies only when choosing SC-8 (5) in lieu of SC-8 (1).
FedRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters 
SC-8 (5)-1 [a hardened or alarmed carrier Protective Distribution System (PDS) when outside of Controlled Access Area (CAA)]
SC-8 (5)-2 [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to information] 

SC-8 Guidance:
SC-8 (5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.

Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA). 

Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2 (1), PE-2 (2), PE-2 (3), PE-3 (2), PE-3 (3), PE-6 (2), and PE-6 (3).

Note: When selecting SC-8 (5), the above SC-8(5), and the above referenced PE controls must be added to the SSP.

Control ID: SC-8 (1)
Name: Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity | Cryptographic Protection
Description: Implement cryptographic mechanisms to [Selection (one or more): prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to information] during transmission.
FedRAMP Parameters: SC-8 (1) [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to information]
FedRAMP Guidance: SC-8 (1) Requirement: Please ensure SSP Section 10.3 Cryptographic Modules Implemented for Data At Rest (DAR) and Data In Transit (DIT) is fully populated for reference in this control.

SC-8 (1) Guidance:
See M-22-09, including "Agencies encrypt all DNS requests and HTTP traffic within their environment"

SC-8 (1) applies when encryption has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. Otherwise refer to SC-8 (5). SC-8 (1) is strongly encouraged.

SC-8 (1) Guidance: Note that this enhancement requires the use of cryptography which must be compliant with Federal requirements and utilize FIPS validated or NSA approved cryptography (see SC-13.)

SC-8 (1) Guidance: When leveraging encryption from the underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some IaaS/PaaS services provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be configured, and enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify encryption is properly configured.

## Key Changes from Revision 4 to Revision 5

Based on research from official FedRAMP sources and industry analysis:

### Overall Statistics
- **Moderate Baseline Total**: 323 controls (decreased from 325 in Rev 4)
- **Net Change**: 21 new controls added, 2 controls removed
- **Parameter Changes**: 100 controls have modified parameters

### Major Changes

#### 1. Threat-Based Methodology
- FedRAMP introduced a threat-based methodology aligned with MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- 17 additional controls added to Moderate baseline beyond NIST 800-53 Rev 5

#### 2. Privacy Integration
- AT-3 now mandates privacy training in addition to security training
- CM-3 and CM-4 require privacy impact analysis for configuration changes
- CP-9 requires backup of privacy-related system documentation

#### 3. Password Requirements Updates
- Removed specific elements: minimum/maximum age, reuse restrictions, minimum character changes
- Simplified password complexity requirements

#### 4. Configuration Management
- CM-6 now requires DoD STIGs with CIS Level 2 benchmarks as alternative
- Stricter configuration baseline requirements

#### 5. Red Team Exercises
- New mandatory annual Red Team exercises for all Rev 5 assessments
- In addition to standard FedRAMP penetration testing

### Implementation Impact
The transition to Rev 5 represents a significant shift toward:
- Modern threat-based security approaches
- Enhanced privacy protections
- Streamlined but strengthened authentication
- More rigorous ongoing security testing
